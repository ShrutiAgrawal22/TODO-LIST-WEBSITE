# React + Vite

Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of task rendering using React.js. Task rendering is a fundamental aspect of many web applications, especially those involving to-do lists, project management tools, and more. This repository serves as a starting point for understanding how to efficiently render tasks dynamically in a React.js application.

Features:
Task Creation: Users can create new tasks with relevant details.
Task Display: Tasks are rendered dynamically in the UI, facilitating easy viewing and management.

Technologies Used:
React.js: The core framework used for building the user interface.
JavaScript (ES6+): For writing the application logic and handling task data.
CSS (or styled-components): For styling the user interface and enhancing the visual appeal.
Git: Version control system for managing the project codebase.
GitHub: Hosting the project repository and collaboration among contributors.
